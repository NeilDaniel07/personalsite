        <h3>STEM - Advanced Math & Science</h3>
        <p>I've always loved mathematics and have now discovered a love for biology. My STEM skills are not only advanced, but STEM is my passion. I've won a grade wide timed math competition twice and gotten second place once. </p>

        <h3>Web Development, Swift, and Python</h3>
        <p>I began learning Python 3 years ago, which has fostered a love for computer programming in me. Since then, I've learned Swift and developed an app (which is not published yet) and I'm fluent in HTML and CSS.</p>

        <h3>Percussion</h3>
        <p>After drumming for three years, I joined the school band at Lees Corner Elementary and took up percussion. I'm now in the Symphonic Band at Franklin Middle School. </p>

        <h3>Swimming</h3>
        <p>I've been in the pool since I was six months old. At six, I joined the community swim team and was selected for exclusive meets. Now, I swim in the Senior Silver division with the Potomac Marlins Swim Club. </p>

        <h3>Volunteering - JPMF Splash</h3>
        <p>I began volunteering with JPMF Splash in Fall 2019. Their mission is to help special needs children learn water safety. I have been working with a five year old. It warms my heart seeing his joy to enter the water every time we are
          together!</p>

        <h3>Drumming</h3>
        <p>Since 2015, I have been drumming and performing with others at the community level. I drum daily and have performed twice. </p>

        <img class="journalism" class="odd" src="images/education (1).png" alt="">
        <h3>Journalism</h3>
        <p>In fourth grade, I had an idea to create a newspaper for my school. With a friend, I did so and we released issues monthly. It took off and was extremely popular among students and staff. Now, I am the chief editor of the community
          newsletter. </p>

        <img class="electronics" class="even" src="images/education.png" alt="">
        <h3>Electronics & Circuits</h3>
        <p>My dad bought me a set of snap circuits when I was young and I made it my mission to complete every project in that set. A few years later, I took a tecnology education course and was so interested in circuits that I bought my own set.
